## <img src="https://github.com/reactivedroid.png" width="100px;" height="100px;" alt="Ashwini Kumar" /> Hello! üëã I'm Ashwini Kumar
I'm currently working as the Director of Engineering at [PayU Credit](https://www.lazypay.in/) involved in building mobile and web apps(LazyPay & Paysense) for scale. In addition to my role here, I hold the distinction of being recognized as a [Google Developer Expert in Firebase](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-ashwini-kumar). Furthermore, I find great fulfillment in my role as a [Mentor at Scaler](https://www.scaler.com/), where I have the privilege of guiding and nurturing aspiring talents. I'm a proud Computer Science alumnus of [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/), with a track record of architecting and developing applications that have made a significant impact on the Indian tech landscape. My experience spans diverse domains, including Gaming([Mobile Premier League](https://www.mpl.live/)), FinTech([InCred](https://www.incred.com/)),  Entertainment([Disney+Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com/)), Healthcare and eCommerce([1mg](https://www.1mg.com/)), HCM Fusion Apps([Oracle](www.oracle.com)), and Agro & Construction Tech([Trimble](https://www.trimble.com/)). As technology continues to evolve, I am committed to the pursuit of engineering excellence every day üéØ

When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring articles and open-source repositories to gather fresh ideas that can be shared with the team. I also enjoy spending time with friends, engaging in board games like Secret Hitler and Codenames ü•∑
