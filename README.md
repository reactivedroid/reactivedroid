He has graduated in Computer Science from [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/). Throughout his career, he has developed/architected applications in many organisations encompassing several domains viz. Gaming([Mobile Premier League](https://www.mpl.live/)), FinTech([InCred](https://www.incred.com/)),  Entertainment([Disney+Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com/)), Healthcare and eCommerce([1mg](https://www.1mg.com/)), HCM Fusion Apps([Oracle](www.oracle.com)), and Agro & Construction Tech([Trimble](https://www.trimble.com/)).
