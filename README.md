## <img src="https://github.com/reactivedroid.png" width="100px;" height="100px;" alt="Ashwini Kumar" /> Hi üëã,  I'm Ashwini Kumar
An engineer currently working as Director of Engineering at [PayU Credit](https://www.lazypay.in/), where I spearhead the development of mobile and web apps for scale. With over a decade of experience, I specialize in crafting systems designed for performance and scale.

As a [Google Developer Expert in Firebase](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-ashwini-kumar), I leverage cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation. Additionally, I find immense satisfaction in my role as a Mentor at [Scaler](https://www.scaler.com/), guiding and nurturing aspiring talents.

A proud Computer Science alumnus of [National Institute of Technology, Tiruchhirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu/), I've led projects spanning diverse domains‚Äîfrom Gaming([Mobile Premier League](https://www.mpl.live/)), FinTech([InCred](https://www.incred.com/)),  Entertainment([Disney+Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com/)), Healthcare and eCommerce([1mg](https://www.1mg.com/)), HCM Fusion Apps([Oracle](www.oracle.com)), and Agro & Construction Tech([Trimble](https://www.trimble.com/)).

In addition to my technical prowess, I excel in leadership and technical management, driving cross-functional teams towards ambitious goals. Committed to engineering excellence, I stay at the forefront of technological advancements.

When not immersed in code, I explore articles and open-source repositories for fresh ideas to share with my team. I also enjoy quality time with friends, engaging in board games like Monopoly, and Life. Let's connect and innovate together! üéØ
