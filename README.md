## Full-Stack Engineering Leader

As a seasoned engineering leader, I am proud to serve as the **Senior Engineering Manager at [Omio](https://www.omio.com/)**, where I am spearheading the establishment and growth of a new engineering team in India. This initiative is focused on driving Omio‚Äôs expansion and building innovative solutions that redefine the travel experience.

Before joining Omio, I held a leadership role at [PayU](https://lazypay.in), a prominent FinTech company, where I led a dynamic and high-performing team. Together, we delivered cutting-edge financial solutions that enhanced user experiences, optimized scalability, and drove impactful business outcomes.

With **over a decade of experience** developing customer-facing applications, I specialize in **crafting highly scalable systems** using the latest in **cutting-edge technologies**. My work spans industries including **FinTech**, **Gaming**, **Entertainment**, **Healthcare**, and **eCommerce**, allowing me to bring a diverse, holistic approach to technical leadership.

### **Google Developer Expert in Firebase**
Recognized as a **[Google Developer Expert in Firebase](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory?text=Ashwini%20Kumar)**, I leverage my expertise to integrate real-time, cloud-based solutions into consumer applications, helping businesses innovate faster and smarter.

### **Mentorship and Community Involvement**
I‚Äôm equally passionate about mentoring. As a mentor at **[Scaler](https://www.scaler.com/)**, I take pride in guiding the next generation of engineering talent, helping them unlock their potential and build meaningful careers in tech.

### **Engineering Leadership and Tech Management**
A proud alumnus of the **[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu/)**, my journey has included leading large, cross-functional teams at companies like **Disney+ Hotstar**, **Mobile Premier League**, **InCred**, **1mg**, and **Oracle**. From handling architectural overhauls to managing large-scale project deliveries, I ensure that teams remain aligned with business goals while pushing technical boundaries.

### **Continuous Learning and Exploration**
I'm driven by the ethos of **continuous improvement** ‚Äî as both an engineer and a leader. I constantly explore new technologies and open-source repositories to stay at the forefront of modern engineering trends. This drive feeds directly into my leadership approach, where I emphasize innovation and sustainable growth.

In my downtime, you'll often find me immersed in board games like **Monopoly** and **Life**, or diving into the latest articles on emerging technologies to bring fresh ideas back to the table. 

I‚Äôm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals. Let‚Äôs collaborate and **build the future** together! üöÄ
